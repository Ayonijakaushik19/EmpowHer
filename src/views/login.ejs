    <h3 class="title" id="about">ABOUT US</h3>
    <p>According to READ GLOBAL one of the key enablers for women empowerment is the need for a “safe space” for women to gather and learn. However, as of now there is no such virtual platform available. 
      The next enabler for women empowerment is to teach women job skills and seed businesses. There is also a need to build their self-esteem and confidence. With EMPOWER we propose a platform for women to build, grow and learn together. 
      We aim to create communities of women that support each other along with the skill enhancement and upliftment provided to them by NGOs on the platform. 
      We aim to curate a platform where women can connect, share their thoughts, promote their businesses, connect with potential recruiters and get quick replies to common questions through conversational AI.</p>

    <p class="quote">“Totally enjoyed and learned a lot in a comfortable environment. The style and the knowledge of the presenter, was totally amazing. 
      The techniques personally helped me to get over some of my shyness and even stage fear. I am happy to try and introduce it to others. 
      The workshop was an experience in itself, unlike any other acting workshop (which I have had regularly). It is easy and enjoyable and deeply powerful. Glad to know this teaching. Thanks a lot!” </p>
